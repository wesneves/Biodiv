#' @title Bdist - Species-by-species distances
#' @description All species were characterized for a set of 10 functional traits, five of them continuous: body size, mean elevation above sea level, mean wood diameter, decay stage of dead wood, and canopy cover of forests in which a species occurs. Categorical traits included three binary traits flower visiting, coniferous host trees, and broad-leaved host trees, and two traits with three categories each microhabitat guild of larvae, and feeding type. Species-by-species distances were computed by means of a Gower-distance with equal weighting on each trait except for the two binary host tree traits.
#' @format A data frame with 120 rows and 120 variables:
#' @usage there’ll be no need to use data(). The data isn’t actually loaded into R until you use it (that’s what “lazy load” means).
