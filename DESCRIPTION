Description: Package designed to quantify the functional and taxonomic diversity of natural communities following Anne Chao's approach as outlined in her 2019 article titled "An attribute-diversity approach to functional diversity, functional beta diversity, and related (dis)similarity measures." Additionally, I introduce a function for computing Functional Redundancy, leveraging the desirable mathematical properties of Chao's taxonomic and functional diversity metrics to calculate the functional redundancy within communities.
